This project seeks to cluster counties based on their Expected Annual Loss Rate for Buildings (in 2022 dollars) for 17 different natural disaster hazards (coastal flooding, avalanche, earthquake, etc). The goal is to find outlier counties in each cluster and determine if they are exeptionally at-risk or particularly underresourced compared to other counties in their cluster. This is important because counties that are relatively similar in terms of hazard risk but are outliers within their clusters can be unlike their neighbors and get overlooked in regional planning, so it is important to find gaps and places that could fall through the cracks.
